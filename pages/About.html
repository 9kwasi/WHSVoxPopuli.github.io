		<h3>Vox Populi - The Voice of the People</h3>
		<p>We are a community outreach/telecommunications based club that provides community members with both a physical and digital medium in which to express their ideas. Vox Populi exists primarily to provide a medium, an audience, and moderation for those who wish to express their ideas through discussion, seminar, and/or lecture. We hope to actively engage others in topics presented intuitively and maintain a high level of discussion for anyone to join.</p>
		<p>We are NOT constraining discussions to specifically philosophy, or topics of socio-political nature. Vox Populi hopes to serve as a means to express ideas in general; everything from Religious Tolerance to Global Apathy to Linguistics to the Economics of Illicit Industrial Pharmacology are all welcome topics.</p>
		<h3>General meetings</h3>
		<p>We will be having general discussions/socratic seminars <b>every Friday</b> during lunch in Mr. Johnsonâ€™s room. Topics of discussion will range from philosophy, to politics, to science, etc. Topics can be submitted by members through google forms.</p>
		<h3>Symposiums</h3>
		<p>Every couple of weeks we will be assembling symposiums consisting of 3-5 speakers that will be giving 10 minute talks on whatever topic they choose. Speakers may choose to have time allotted after their talk to discuss/debate any ideas presented.</p>
		<p>Any member of the community can sign up to speak for a symposium. We have a committee that will vet speakers beforehand to check for preparedness and school appropriateness. This committee is also a resource available to less experienced speakers who are seeking assistance for their upcoming symposium talk.</p>
		<p>All talks will be posted online on our website.</p>
